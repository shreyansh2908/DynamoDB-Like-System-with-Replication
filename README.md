# DynamoDB-Like System Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a DynamoDB-like system with functionality for distributed data storage and replication. It is divided into backend and frontend components, ensuring a modular and scalable architecture.

## Directory Structure

```plaintext
Team_19/
├── backend/         # Contains server-side logic and API implementations
├── frontend/        # Contains client-side code and UI components
├── main.py          # Entry point for running the application
├── requirements.txt  
├── snapshots/       # Stores test snapshots or state information
├── README.md
├── Report.pdf

```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Tkinter



## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```


## Features

- Distributed data storage and replication.
- Modular architecture with separate frontend and backend components.
- Snapshot functionality for testing and debugging.

## Development

### Backend
The backend code is located in the `backend` directory. Modify the logic as needed and ensure compatibility with the frontend.

### Frontend
The frontend code is located in the `frontend` directory. Use modern UI frameworks like React (if applicable) to enhance the user experience.

### Main Application
`main.py` serves as the entry point for the backend server. Ensure all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are installed before running.

## Testing

1. Ensure the backend server is running.
2. Run the provided test script or use snapshot functionality in the `snapshots` directory to verify system behavior.
